## Features

- Add new tasks with a category (e.g., Work, Personal).
- Mark tasks as completed with a checkbox.
- Delete tasks from the list.
- LocalStorage persistence for tasks.
- Responsive design for various screen sizes.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-list-app.git

   cd todo-list-app

   yarn install

   yarn start

The app will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

## Usage
- Add tasks using the "Add Task" form.
- Mark tasks as completed by checking the checkbox.
- Delete tasks by clicking the "Delete" button.
- Tasks are saved to LocalStorage and persist across page refreshes.

## Future Improvements

- Enhance the layout for smaller devices.
- Implement device-specific optimizations for a better user experience on known devices.
- Consider improving the design aesthetics to achieve a more luxurious feel. Note: Due to tight deadlines, the current design may not fully reflect intended aesthetics.
- If encountering any issues with app usage, try reloading the page or restarting the app for a smoother experience.


## Technologies Used
- React
- TypeScript
- CSS (styles)
- LocalStorage (persistence)

## Issues
- If you encounter any issues during usage, try reloading the page or restarting the app.

# Improved Approach: Persistent and Unique Task IDs

## Challenges
In my initial implementation, I encountered challenges with managing unique task IDs, especially when tasks were deleted, and add task, leading to inconsistencies. To address this, I introduced a more robust solution by utilizing local storage to persist and manage task IDs.

## Implementation Details
I utilized the following approach in my code:

```javascript
const initialId = parseInt(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("id") ?? "1"));
const initialTodos = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("todos") ?? "[]");
const [todos, setTodos] = useState(initialTodos);
let [id, setId] = useState(initialId);

useEffect(() => {
  localStorage.setItem("todos", JSON.stringify(todos));
  localStorage.setItem("id", JSON.stringify(id));
}, [todos, id]);

const handleAddTodo = (
  name: string,
  description: string,
  category: string
) => {
  const newTodo = {
    id: id,
    name,
    description,
    completed: false,
    category,
  };
  setId((id) => id + 1);
  setTodos((prevTodos) => [...prevTodos, newTodo]);
};
.
Key Points:
Initialization: I initialize the task ID (id) and the list of todos (todos) by retrieving their values from local storage. If these values are not present, default values are used (1 for ID and an empty array for todos).

State Management: The id state is used to track the last used ID for task creation. The todos state maintains the list of tasks.

Use of useEffect: I use the useEffect hook to update local storage whenever there is a change in the todos or id state. This ensures that the latest data is persisted.

Generating Unique IDs: The handleAddTodo function generates a new unique ID for each task, ensuring that the IDs are sequential and unique. The new ID is then used for the newly created task.

Benefits
Consistency: This approach ensures consistent and unique IDs, even when tasks are added or deleted.

Persistence: Task data and the last used ID are persistently stored in local storage, allowing the application to recover its state after a page refresh or reopening.

Improved Robustness: The use of local storage provides a reliable and simple mechanism for managing IDs, enhancing the overall robustness of the application.
